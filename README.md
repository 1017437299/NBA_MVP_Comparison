Data Analysis of 2014-2015 NBA MVP race between Stephen Curry and James Harden

James Harden has recently came out stating that he deserved to be last year's MVP instead of Stephen Curry so I wanted to do a little data analysis to see if he has a case or not. In this repo, is my ipython notebook script and an image of a few bar graphs that compare Harden's and Curry's season stats.
