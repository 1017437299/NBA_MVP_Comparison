# NBA_MVP_Comparison
My analysis of 2014-2015 NBA MVP race between Stephen Curry and James Harden

James Harden has recently came out stating that he deserved to be last year's MVP instead of Stephen Curry so I wanted to do a little data analysis to see if he has a case. 
I decided to use ipython to do this analysis because it presented the statistics comparison dataframe very nicely. However, I couldn't produce the statistics bar graphs cleanly so I decided to generate these using pycharm and just add the .png image to the repo. My complete analysis can be found at my website.
